#### Convolutions

> Summation of dot product of the sub-matrices of input matrix with given matrix using horizontal strides to obtain corresponding element of resultant matrix

#### Filters/Kernels

> The matrices which are used for convoluting images for CNN are called Filters/Kernels

#### Epochs
	
> Number of times a model is trained/learned on all of the train data.

#### 1x1 Convolution
	
> Convolution with filters of size 1 - i.e 1 row and 1 column. Results in linear combination of existing channels to given number of filters

#### 3x3 Convolution
	
> Convolution with filters of size 3 - i.e 3 rows and 3 columns. 

#### Feature Maps
	
> Resultant matrix obtained after convolution and passing through activation function

#### Activation Function
	
> A math function which acts like a gateway i.e which gives certain output based on the input

#### Receptive Field
	
> Receptive Feild of a particular pixel/element is the no. of pixels/elements in previous layers that has contributed for its current value
